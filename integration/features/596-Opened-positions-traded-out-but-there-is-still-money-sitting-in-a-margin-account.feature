Feature: Regression test for issue 596

  Background:
    Given the insurance pool initial balance for the markets is "0":
    And the markets:
      | id        | quote name | asset | auction duration | risk model                    | margin calculator         | fees         | price monitoring | oracle config          |
      | ETH/DEC19 | BTC        | BTC   | 1                | default-log-normal-risk-model | default-margin-calculator | default-none | default-none     | default-eth-for-future |
    And oracles broadcast data signed with "0xDEADBEEF":
      | name             | value |
      | prices.ETH.value | 42    |

  Scenario: Traded out position but monies left in margin account
    Given the traders make the following deposits on asset's general account:
      | trader  | asset | amount  |
      | edd     | BTC   | 10000   |
      | barney  | BTC   | 10000   |
      | chris   | BTC   | 10000   |
      | trader1 | BTC   | 1000000 |
      | trader2 | BTC   | 1000000 |
      | aux     | BTC   | 1000    |

  # place auxiliary orders so we always have best bid and best offer as to not trigger the liquidity auction
    When traders place the following orders:
      | trader  | market id | side | volume | price | resulting trades | type        | tif     |
      | aux     | ETH/DEC19 | buy  | 1      | 95    | 0                | TYPE_LIMIT  | TIF_GTC |
      | aux     | ETH/DEC19 | sell | 1      | 105   | 0                | TYPE_LIMIT  | TIF_GTC |

    # Trigger an auction to set the mark price
    Then traders place the following orders:
      | trader  | market id | side | volume | price | resulting trades | type       | tif     | reference |
      | trader1 | ETH/DEC19 | buy  | 1      | 100   | 0                | TYPE_LIMIT | TIF_GFA | trader1-2 |

    Then the opening auction period for market "ETH/DEC19" ends
    And the mark price for the market "ETH/DEC19" is "100"

    When traders place the following orders:
      | trader | market id | side | volume | price | resulting trades | type       | tif     | reference |
